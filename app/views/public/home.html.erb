        <p>Welcome to Dragon Cave! Dragon Cave is an online adoptables game. Collect eggs, raise them to adulthood,
          and then breed them to cre­ate interesting lineages. New dragons are added regularly!</p>

      <p class="h5">The Cave</p>
      <p>You enter the cave and see many large dragons scattered about,
        some with hatchlings, sleeping on piles of gold.</p>
      <% if account_signed_in? %>
        <p>You also see a pile of scrolls on the ground. Having been here before,
          you have started recording information about the growth and progress of your eggs.</p>
      <% else %>
        <p>You also see a pile of scrolls on the ground. If you’d like, you can take one to record your travels on,
          or if you already have one, you can pick it up.</p>
      <% end %>
      <p>Near the entrance to the cave, there are some abandoned eggs.
        If you don’t want the dragons inside to die, you can take one of those instead.</p>
      <p>One of the scrolls in the pile contains a map charting dragon habitats across Galsreim and the surrounding area.
